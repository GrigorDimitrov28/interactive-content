You are assigned to implement a **Web application** (SPA) using HTML5, JavaScript, AJAX, REST and JSON with cloud\-based backend \(Firebase or Kinvey\).

Using libraries like **jQuery**, **Handlebars** and **PageJs** is allowed but is **not obligatory**.

The app keeps **users** and **articles**.

**Users** should be able to **register** and **login**.

Logged\-in users should be able to view all articles, create articles, see details about an article and **logout**.

Logged\-in users should also be able to edit or delete the articles they have created. Create a Firebase REST Service.

Register at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and create application to keep your data in the cloud.

Create a collection called **articles**.

Each **article** has a **title**, **category**, **content** and **creator.**

## The SoftWiki - HTML and CSS

You have been given the web design of the application as **HTML** \+ **CSS** files.

- Initially all views and forms are shown by the HTML. 

Your application may **hide/show elements** by CSS **(display: none)** or **delete/reattach** from and to the DOM all unneeded elements, or just display the views it needs to display.

- You may render the views/forms/components with **JavaScript** or **Handlebars**.

## Important

Don't change the elements' class names and ids.

Don't rename form fields/link names/ids.

You are **allowed** to add **data attributes** to any elements.

You may modify **href attributes** of links and add **action/method** **attributes** to **forms**, to allow the use of a routing library.

**2. The SoftWiki- Client-Side Web Application**

**Design** and **implement** a client\-side front-end app (SPA) for managing articles. Implement the functionality described below.

## Navigation Bar (5 Pts)

Navigation links should correctly change the current page (view).

- Clicking on the links in the **Header** should display the view behind the link (views are represented as sections in the HTML code).

- Your application may **hide/show elements** by CSS \(**display**\: **none**\) or **delete/reattach** from and to the DOM all unneeded elements, or just display the views it needs to display.

The Logged-in user navbar should contain the following elements: `[SoftWiki]` which is a link to the **Home Page**, `[Create]` **and** `[Logout]`

- The guest users header should contain the following elements:  `[SoftWiki]` which is a link to the Login page and `[Register]`.

[image assetsSrc="js-application-exam(5).png" /]

## Register User (5 Pts)

By given **email** and **password**, the app should register a new user in the system and should **redirect you to the home page.**

- Keep the user local data in the browser's **local/session storage.**

Register once and create/read awesome articles!

[image assetsSrc="js-application-exam(6).png" /]

## Login User / Guest Home Page (5 Pts)

By given **email** and **password**, the app should login an existing user.

- Keep the user local data in the browser's local storage.

- After a successful login **redirect to the home page.**

You are one step away from awesome articles!

## Home Page (40 Pts)

Successfully logged-in users should be welcomed by the **Home page.**

They should be able to see all created articles.

[image assetsSrc="js-application-exam(8).png" /]

If there are **NO** such articles, the following view should be displayed:

[image assetsSrc="js-application-exam(9).png" /]

## Create Article (10 Pts)

Logged-in users should be able to Create articles.

Clicking the `[Create]` link in the **NavBar** should display the **Create Article page.**

- **By default**, every newly created article must have additional information:

  - **Creator:** the email of the current user;

- The newly organizer article should be stored in the Firebase\Kinvey collection `articles`.

- After an article is created successfully you should be redirected to the **Home Page.**

[image assetsSrc="js-application-exam(10).png" /]

## Details (15 Pts)

Logged-in users should be able to **view details** about articles.

Clicking the `[Details]` link in of a **particular article** should **display** the **Article Details page.**

- If the currently logged-in user is the creator of the article, the `[Edit]` and `[Delete]` **buttons** should be set to **visible**, otherwise there should be only 1 button `[Back]` which redirects to the Home Page.
